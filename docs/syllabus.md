# Connected Vehicles Syllabus

This course teaches concepts of cybersecurity in modern day vehicles. ECU design and interoperation, along with Embedded development and OTA updates, will be discussed and explored.

## Description

Connected Vehicles provides a comprehensive exploration of the rapidly evolving field of automotive communication technology. This course explores the intricacies of embedded development, focusing specifically on its application in modern vehicles.

Students will gain a deep understanding of the cybersecurity challenges and strategies associated with automotive vehicles, learning how to safeguard them against potential threats.

This course covers a few primary components:

- Electronic Control Unit (ECU) design and interoperation
- Learning and applying knowledge of C and Python for use in embedded development
- Over-the-Air (OTA) updates to embedded devices including the process, benefits, and risks associated with OTA updates.

Prerequisites: CS3053/CYB3053 or instructor approval. Prior coursework in computer science, electrical engineering, or a related field is highly recommended. Students will also need experience in C and Python. Knowledge in embedded systems and electronics will be useful, but not required.

## Academic Integrity

In keeping with the intellectual ideals, standards for community, and educational mission of the University, students are expected to adhere to all academic policies.
Cheating on examinations, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty violate both individual honor and the life of the community, and may subject students to penalties including failing grades, dismissal, and other disciplinary actions.

Any student found to have committed academic misconduct activities will, in the first instance, receive a grade of 0 on the assignment or exam.
In the second instance, the student will receive a failing grade for the course.
Note that this includes copying code or writing from the Internet or other resources without attribution.
Note that University policy requires me to notify the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the event of identifying academic misconduct.

Additionally, utilizing large language model (LLM) services such as ChatGPT is not permitted when writing code or preparing answers to assigned work unless otherwise specified by the instructor.
Utilizing LLMs without attribution will be treated as academic misconduct.
